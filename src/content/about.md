I am a capable software engineer with extensive experience working in backend systems, from simple client-server models, to microservices, to creative hybrid deployments using infrastructure-as-code. I have strong analytical skills, a passion for my work, and a track record of producing robust, scalable software solutions. I have an intuition for software design and enjoy almost nothing more than seeing a good design come to fruition.

I work best in positions that encompass all aspects of software engineering, from the code itself to high-level system architecture. I also enjoy intellectual discussion and teaching others, so I do well on teams that prioritize collaboration and that provide opportunities to mentor junior members. I value positions where I can work autonomously, with the freedom to improve my methods and collaborate with others when needed.
